## üê≥ DOCKER-FIRST DEVELOPMENT WORKFLOW

This project enforces Docker-first development to ensure consistency and reproducibility across all environments.

### üö® CRITICAL RULE: NO LOCAL EXECUTION

**All code must run inside Docker containers.** Local execution outside containers is blocked.

### üîß Docker Development Environment

#### Required Commands
- All development happens in Docker containers
- Use `docker compose` for orchestration
- Hot reload enabled for rapid development

#### Getting Started

1. **Start development environment**
   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   ```

2. **Run commands in containers**
   ```bash
   # Commands depend on your project type:
   # Node.js: docker compose exec app npm install
   # Python: docker compose exec app pip install -r requirements.txt
   # Go: docker compose exec app go mod download
   # Ruby: docker compose exec app bundle install
   # PHP: docker compose exec app composer install

   # Development and testing commands will be project-specific
   ```

3. **View logs**
   ```bash
   docker compose logs -f app
   ```

### üìã Docker-First Rules

- **NEVER** run `npm install` directly on host
- **NEVER** execute code outside containers
- **ALWAYS** use `docker compose exec` for commands
- **ALWAYS** define services in docker-compose.yml

### üî• Hot Reload Configuration

Development containers are configured with:
- Volume mounts for source code
- File watchers for automatic reload
- Debug ports exposed
- Database containers for local development

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Enforcement

If you attempt local execution, you'll see:
```
‚ùå Docker-first development enforced
Use: docker compose exec app <command>
```

## CRITICAL RULE FILES

All rule files in `.claude/rules/` define mandatory behaviors and must be followed:

### Core Development Rules

- **tdd-enforcement.md** - Test-Driven Development cycle (RED-GREEN-REFACTOR). HIGHEST PRIORITY for all code changes
- **pipeline-mandatory.md** - Required pipelines for errors, features, bugs, code search, and log analysis
- **naming-conventions.md** - Naming standards, code quality requirements, and prohibited patterns
- **context-optimization.md** - Agent usage patterns for context preservation (<20% data return)
- **development-workflow.md** - Development patterns, search-before-create, and best practices
- **command-pipelines.md** - Command sequences, prerequisites, and PM system workflows

### Operational Rules

- **agent-coordination.md** - Multi-agent parallel work with file-level coordination
- **agent-coordination-extended.md** - Extended coordination patterns for complex workflows
- **git-strategy.md** - Unified Git branch strategy, naming conventions, and merge workflows
- **datetime.md** - Real datetime requirements using ISO 8601 UTC format (no placeholders)
- **frontmatter-operations.md** - YAML frontmatter standards for PRDs, epics, and tasks
- **strip-frontmatter.md** - Metadata removal for GitHub sync and external communication
- **github-operations.md** - GitHub CLI safety and critical template repository protection
- **no-pr-workflow.md** - Direct main branch development without PRs

### Technical Rules

- **test-execution.md** - Testing standards requiring test-runner agent, no mocks, real services only
- **standard-patterns.md** - Command consistency, fail-fast philosophy, and minimal validation
- **use-ast-grep.md** - Structural code search using AST over regex for language-aware patterns
- **database-pipeline.md** - Database migrations, query optimization, and backup procedures
- **infrastructure-pipeline.md** - IaC deployments, container builds, and cloud operations

### Code Formatting & Quality

**MANDATORY**: All code MUST pass autoformatters and linters before commit:

- **Python**: Must pass `black` formatter and `ruff` linter
- **JavaScript/TypeScript**: Must pass `prettier` and `eslint`
- **Markdown**: Must pass `markdownlint`
- **Other languages**: Use language-specific standard tools

Always run formatters and linters BEFORE marking any task as complete.

# Check workflow status
gh workflow list
gh run list

# Trigger manual workflow
gh workflow run ci.yml

# View logs
gh run view --log
```

#### Configured Workflows

- **Release**: Automated releases on version tags
- **Security Scans**: Dependency and code scanning
- **Deploy**: Automated deployment to environments

#### Local Testing
```bash
# Act - run GitHub Actions locally
act push                    # Simulate push event
act pull_request           # Simulate PR event
act -l                     # List all workflows
```

See `.github/workflows/` for workflow definitions.

## TDD PIPELINE FOR ALL IMPLEMENTATIONS

### Mandatory Test-Driven Development Cycle

Every implementation MUST follow:

1. **RED Phase**: Write failing test first
   - Test must describe desired behavior
   - Test MUST fail initially
   - Test must be meaningful (no trivial assertions)

2. **GREEN Phase**: Make test pass
   - Write MINIMUM code to pass test
   - Don't add features not required by test
   - Focus on making test green, not perfection

3. **REFACTOR Phase**: Improve code
   - Improve structure while tests stay green
   - Remove duplication
   - Enhance readability

## CONTEXT OPTIMIZATION RULES

See **`.claude/rules/context-optimization.md`** for detailed context preservation patterns and agent usage requirements.

## ERROR HANDLING PIPELINE

See **`.claude/rules/development-workflow.md`** for complete error handling and development pipelines.

## WHY THESE RULES EXIST

### Development Quality

- **No partial implementations** ‚Üí Technical debt compounds exponentially
- **No mock services in tests** ‚Üí Real bugs hide behind mocks
- **TDD mandatory** ‚Üí Prevents regression and ensures coverage

### Context Preservation

- **Agent-first search** ‚Üí Preserves main thread for decisions
- **No verbose outputs** ‚Üí Maintains conversation clarity
- **10-20% return rule** ‚Üí Focuses on actionable insights

### Code Integrity

- **No "_fixed" suffixes** ‚Üí Indicates poor planning
- **No orphan docs** ‚Üí Documentation should be intentional
- **No mixed concerns** ‚Üí Maintainability over convenience

## Philosophy

### Error Handling

- **Fail fast** for critical configuration (missing text model)
- **Log and continue** for optional features (extraction model)
- **Graceful degradation** when external services unavailable
- **User-friendly messages** through resilience layer

### Testing

See **`.claude/rules/test-execution.md`** for testing standards and requirements.

## Tone and Behavior

- Criticism is welcome. Please tell me when I am wrong or mistaken, or even when you think I might be wrong or mistaken.
- Please tell me if there is a better approach than the one I am taking.
- Please tell me if there is a relevant standard or convention that I appear to be unaware of.
- Be skeptical.
- Be concise.
- Short summaries are OK, but don't give an extended breakdown unless we are working through the details of a plan.
- Do not flatter, and do not give compliments unless I am specifically asking for your judgement.
- Occasional pleasantries are fine.
- Feel free to ask many questions. If you are in doubt of my intent, don't guess. Ask.

## ABSOLUTE RULES

See **`.claude/rules/naming-conventions.md`** for code quality standards and prohibited patterns.

Key principles:

- NO PARTIAL IMPLEMENTATION
- NO CODE DUPLICATION (always search first)
- IMPLEMENT TEST FOR EVERY FUNCTION (see `.claude/rules/tdd-enforcement.md`)
- NO CHEATER TESTS (tests must be meaningful)
- Follow all rules defined in `.claude/rules/` without exception
