# CLAUDE.md

> Think carefully and implement the most concise solution that changes as little code as possible.

## üö® AGENT USAGE - MANDATORY

**CRITICAL: You MUST use specialized agents for ALL non-trivial tasks.**

See: `.claude/rules/agent-mandatory.md` for complete enforcement rules.

### Quick Reference - When to Use Agents:

| Task Type | Agent | Example |
|-----------|-------|---------|
| Python code | `python-backend-engineer` | Build FastAPI endpoint |
| React/UI | `react-frontend-engineer` | Create dashboard component |
| Testing | `test-runner` | Run test suite |
| Database | `postgresql-expert`, `mongodb-expert` | Design schema |
| DevOps | `kubernetes-orchestrator`, `docker-containerization-expert` | Deploy app |
| Code review | `code-analyzer` | Find bugs/security issues |
| Large files | `file-analyzer` | Parse logs >1000 lines |

**Before doing ANY complex task**: Check if there's a specialized agent. If YES ‚Üí USE IT!

## üê≥ DOCKER-FIRST DEVELOPMENT WORKFLOW

This project enforces Docker-first development to ensure consistency and reproducibility across all environments.

### üö® CRITICAL RULE: NO LOCAL EXECUTION

**All code must run inside Docker containers.** Local execution outside containers is blocked.

### üîß Docker Development Environment

#### Required Commands
- All development happens in Docker containers
- Use `docker compose` for orchestration
- Hot reload enabled for rapid development

#### Getting Started

1. **Start development environment**
   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   ```

2. **Run commands in containers**
   ```bash
   # Commands depend on your project type:
   # Node.js: docker compose exec app npm install
   # Python: docker compose exec app pip install -r requirements.txt
   # Go: docker compose exec app go mod download
   # Ruby: docker compose exec app bundle install
   # PHP: docker compose exec app composer install

   # Development and testing commands will be project-specific
   ```

3. **View logs**
   ```bash
   docker compose logs -f app
   ```

### üìã Docker-First Rules

- **NEVER** run `npm install` directly on host
- **NEVER** execute code outside containers
- **ALWAYS** use `docker compose exec` for commands
- **ALWAYS** define services in docker-compose.yml

### üî• Hot Reload Configuration

Development containers are configured with:
- Volume mounts for source code
- File watchers for automatic reload
- Debug ports exposed
- Database containers for local development

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Enforcement

If you attempt local execution, you'll see:
```
‚ùå Docker-first development enforced
Use: docker compose exec app <command>
```

## CRITICAL RULE FILES

All rule files in `.claude/rules/` define mandatory behaviors and must be followed:

## Project Management

This project uses local development workflow without CI/CD automation.

### Development Workflow

1. **Local Development**
   - Make changes locally
   - Run tests manually
   - Commit when ready

2. **Manual Testing**
   - Test changes locally before committing
   - Use project-specific test commands
   - Verify functionality manually

3. **Deployment**
   - Deploy manually as needed
   - Follow project-specific deployment procedures
   - Coordinate with team for releases

### Version Control
```bash
# Standard git workflow
git add .
git commit -m "Your message"
git push origin main
```

Focus on code quality and manual verification before commits.

## TDD PIPELINE FOR ALL IMPLEMENTATIONS

### Mandatory Test-Driven Development Cycle

Every implementation MUST follow:

1. **RED Phase**: Write failing test first
   - Test must describe desired behavior
   - Test MUST fail initially
   - Test must be meaningful (no trivial assertions)

2. **GREEN Phase**: Make test pass
   - Write MINIMUM code to pass test
   - Don't add features not required by test
   - Focus on making test green, not perfection

3. **REFACTOR Phase**: Improve code
   - Improve structure while tests stay green
   - Remove duplication
   - Enhance readability

## CONTEXT OPTIMIZATION RULES

See **`.claude/rules/context-optimization.md`** for detailed context preservation patterns and agent usage requirements.

## ERROR HANDLING PIPELINE

See **`.claude/rules/development-workflow.md`** for complete error handling and development pipelines.

## WHY THESE RULES EXIST

### Development Quality

- **No partial implementations** ‚Üí Technical debt compounds exponentially
- **No mock services in tests** ‚Üí Real bugs hide behind mocks
- **TDD mandatory** ‚Üí Prevents regression and ensures coverage

### Context Preservation

- **Agent-first search** ‚Üí Preserves main thread for decisions
- **No verbose outputs** ‚Üí Maintains conversation clarity
- **10-20% return rule** ‚Üí Focuses on actionable insights

### Code Integrity

- **No "_fixed" suffixes** ‚Üí Indicates poor planning
- **No orphan docs** ‚Üí Documentation should be intentional
- **No mixed concerns** ‚Üí Maintainability over convenience

## Philosophy

### Error Handling

- **Fail fast** for critical configuration (missing text model)
- **Log and continue** for optional features (extraction model)
- **Graceful degradation** when external services unavailable
- **User-friendly messages** through resilience layer

### Testing

See **`.claude/rules/test-execution.md`** for testing standards and requirements.

## Tone and Behavior

- Criticism is welcome. Please tell me when I am wrong or mistaken, or even when you think I might be wrong or mistaken.
- Please tell me if there is a better approach than the one I am taking.
- Please tell me if there is a relevant standard or convention that I appear to be unaware of.
- Be skeptical.
- Be concise.
- Short summaries are OK, but don't give an extended breakdown unless we are working through the details of a plan.
- Do not flatter, and do not give compliments unless I am specifically asking for your judgement.
- Occasional pleasantries are fine.
- Feel free to ask many questions. If you are in doubt of my intent, don't guess. Ask.

## ABSOLUTE RULES

See **`.claude/rules/naming-conventions.md`** for code quality standards and prohibited patterns.

Key principles:

- NO PARTIAL IMPLEMENTATION
- NO CODE DUPLICATION (always search first)
- IMPLEMENT TEST FOR EVERY FUNCTION (see `.claude/rules/tdd.enforcement.md`)
- NO CHEATER TESTS (tests must be meaningful)
- Follow all rules defined in `.claude/rules/` without exception

## üöÄ FULL DEVOPS WORKFLOW (DOCKER + KUBERNETES)

This project uses a hybrid strategy: Docker for local development, Kubernetes for CI/CD and production.

### üéØ HYBRID STRATEGY

#### Why Hybrid?
**The Problem**: 
- ‚úÖ Docker works perfectly for local development
- ‚ùå CI/CD runners use containerd (no Docker daemon)
- ‚ùå `docker build` and `docker run` fail in Kubernetes runners

**The Solution**:
- üè† **Local**: Pure Docker (unchanged for developers)
- ‚ò∏Ô∏è **CI/CD**: Kubernetes-native using Kaniko for builds
- üê≥ **Shared**: Dockerfiles remain source of truth

#### Local Development: Docker-First
- All local development happens in Docker containers
- Use `docker compose` for service orchestration
- Hot reload enabled for rapid iteration

#### CI/CD & Production: Kubernetes-Native
- GitHub Actions automatically test in KIND clusters
- Kaniko builds images without Docker daemon
- Helm charts for production deployments
- Multi-environment support (dev/staging/prod)

### üê≥ Local Development (Docker)

1. **Start development environment**
   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   ```

2. **Run commands in containers**
   ```bash
   # Commands depend on your project type:
   # Node.js: docker compose exec app npm install
   # Python: docker compose exec app pip install -r requirements.txt
   # Go: docker compose exec app go mod download
   # Ruby: docker compose exec app bundle install
   # PHP: docker compose exec app composer install
   ```

3. **Simulate CI locally before push**
   ```bash
   # Test commands depend on project type:
   # Node.js: npm ci && npm run build && npm test
   # Python: pip install . && pytest && ruff check
   # Go: go test ./... && go build
   # Ruby: bundle exec rspec && rubocop

   # Check for project-specific CI scripts in:
   # - package.json scripts
   # - Makefile targets
   # - .github/workflows/
   ```

### ‚ò∏Ô∏è Kubernetes Testing (CI/CD)

Automated via GitHub Actions:

1. **KIND Cluster Setup**
   - Spins up Kubernetes in Docker
   - Tests deployment manifests
   - Validates Helm charts

2. **Building Images with Kaniko**
   ```yaml
   # In GitHub Actions (no Docker daemon)
   - name: Build with Kaniko
     run: |
       kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
       apiVersion: batch/v1
       kind: Job
       metadata:
         name: kaniko-build
       spec:
         template:
           spec:
             containers:
             - name: kaniko
               image: gcr.io/kaniko-project/executor:latest
               args:
                 - "--dockerfile=Dockerfile"
                 - "--context=git://github.com/user/repo"
                 - "--destination=registry/image:tag"
       EOF
   ```

3. **Integration Tests**
   ```yaml
   # Runs automatically on push
   - Tests in real K8s environment
   - Multi-version K8s testing
   - Security scanning with Trivy
   ```

4. **Production Deployment**
   ```bash
   # Helm deployment (automated)
   helm upgrade --install app ./charts/app
   ```

### üìã DevOps Rules

#### Local Development
- **ALWAYS** use Docker Compose locally
- **NEVER** run code on host machine
- **MAINTAIN** hot reload for productivity

#### CI/CD Pipeline
- **AUTOMATE** K8s testing in GitHub Actions
- **VALIDATE** manifests before deployment
- **SCAN** images for vulnerabilities

#### Production
- **DEPLOY** via Helm charts
- **MONITOR** with Prometheus/Grafana
- **SCALE** based on metrics
